# iPlayer-Cinema-Mode
Chrome extension the makes BBC iPlayer web player browser width.

As someone who watched iPlayer a lot on my computer whilst I work, only being able to have a really small player or full screen is really annoying. So I made this chrome extension that simply makes the iPlayer video the same width as the browser window. That's all it does.
