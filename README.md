# iPlayer-Cinema-Mode
Chrome extension the makes BBC iPlayer web player browser width.

As someone who watches iPlayer a lot on my computer whilst I work, only being able to have a really small player or full screen is really annoying. So I made this chrome extension that simply makes the iPlayer video the same width as the browser window. That's all it does.

You can add it to chrome yourself by going to chrome://extensions switching on developer mode then drag and dropping the files into the browser. I'm not adding it to the chrome store because it feels like the sort of thing that gets you sued by the BBC.
